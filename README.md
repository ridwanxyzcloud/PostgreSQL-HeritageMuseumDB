This repository contains a PostgreSQL-based database system designed for managing the operations and inventory of a chain of heritage museums. The project includes SQL scripts, data engineering tasks, and sample data to support museum management, focusing on:

    Artists and Artworks: Tracking information about artists, their artworks, and where they are displayed.
    Museum Operations: Managing museum details, including location, hours of operation, and more.
    Inventory Control: Handling product sizes, pricing, and other inventory-related tasks.

Key features of this project:

    Database Design: Includes schema design, primary and foreign keys, and relationships among multiple tables.
    Data Management: SQL scripts for creating and populating tables with sample data.
    Querying and Reporting: SQL queries to extract information for business questions, such as finding museums without paintings or determining the most popular artists.
